# Solitude
A lonely virtual reality experience about how much you can trust AI.

## Description
Solitude is a Virtual Reality experience that reflects on a potential relationship between artificial intelligence and humanity. 
You start as a lone human in the middle of space, with only a newly-activated AI, named ANNA, for company. 
Will you let ANNA help you, or can you save yourself? What will you sacrifice, and at what cost? 
The choice is yours.
